I was planning on creating my own library to control LEGO Power Functions using
an IR LED attached to an arduino and/or Raspberry pi but I found this as a
starting point.  The library seems to have been written prior to V1.0 of the
Arduino software since it references WProgram.h.  Other than this single zip
file I have found only a few references of this library and it's original
author.
